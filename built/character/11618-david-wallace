    <p>David Wallace is Dunder Mifflin’s CEO. He is calm, smart, and professional. He tends to show more patience with Michael, certainly more than Jan. He is based out of the New York office and does not get directly involved in Michael’s antics as much as Jan though.</p>
<p>He is introduced in “Valentine’s Day” where instead of presenting branch financial stats, Michael shows a tribute video set to U2’s With or Without You. David politely asks him for the financial numbers which Michael produces.</p>
<p>David often has to deal with phone calls with urgent messages so Michael can get a call back for his always petty questions or ideas. When Michael interviews for that job, he doesn’t get it, but David thinks Michael is a nice guy,  as we learn in “The Deposition” he doesn’t think Michael would be a good fit for any future promotions.</p>
