    <p>Creed Bratton is a mysterious older man who works for Dunder Mifflin. He is rather bizarre makes confusing statements. He a deleted scene in “Christmas Party” he tells Oscar that he used to host a radio show and in another deleted scene from “Booze Cruise” he plays guitar with the ship’s band. Creed keeps to himself but it is revealed that he has a rather dark side to him.</p>
<p>During one Christmas party he asks what kind of gift Santa would bring if he had done something truly evil. He is a terrible employee. He forgets his job in “Goodbye Toby” and gets a paper mill employee fired after he blew off an inspection. He spends most of his time playing solitaire on his computer and manipulates Michael into firing Devon in “Halloween.”</p>
<p>Despite this, Creed is usually in a cheery mood and likes his co-workers, it’s just that most of them don’t like them, especially Ryan who thinks he has an “old man smell.”</p>
