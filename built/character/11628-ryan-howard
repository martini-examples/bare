    <p>Ryan is the newest addition to Dunder Mifflin as the temp in Season 1 and witnesses Michael’s inappropriate sense of humor when he fake fires Pam, leaving her in tears. Michael lavishes Ryan with unwanted attention and has a severe mancrush on him, but Ryan finds Michael annoying and does his best to ignore him, unless it benefits him.</p>
<p>When Ryan begins dating Kelly, he again finds himself receiving unwanted affection and attention. Ryan is cocky, arrogant, and desperately trying to prove how smart he is. Season 4 sees him promoted to Jan’s old position and he becomes Michael’s boss, but that didn’t last long because he’s arrested for fraud and is fired from the company.</p>
<p>He had to work in a bowling alley until Michael offered him a job with the Michael Scott paper company. Later, he rejoins Dunder Mifflin as a temp in “Weight Loss” and he gets some good hazing. After Season 5 his personality seems to change from episode to episode from bow tie wearing hipster to scarf wearing poet. No one, including Michael, take him seriously anymore.</p>
