Introduced in “The Pilot”, Roy works in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse and is Pam’s finance. He knows that Jim and Pam are friend’s but is unaware that Jim has romantic feelings for her. He is engaged to Pam for four years before he even sets a wedding date so Pam breaks of their engagement in between Season 2 and Season 3.

Roy suffers a breakdown and hits rock bottom after a DUI arrest. In “Gay Witch Hunt” an emotional Roy vows to win back Pam and at Phillys’ wedding, he pays Kevin’s band to play a favorite song of hers and the two decide to give it another try. They break up for good after Roy finds out Jim kissed Pam though.

In “The Negotiation” he attempts to attack Jim before Dwight intervenes and later apologizes to Pam and the two part on good terms. He’d run into Jim when he was out with Darryl and some of the warehouse guys after he’s married to Pam but Dwight didn’t need to break up a fight this time.
